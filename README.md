# DCS_Mission_Manager_GO
Like the v1 attempt at DCS Mission Manager with Python, but from scratch with Golang as the web binary, Discord OAuth Integration for user/upload management, and a small binary for the DCS Host computer to reach up and stream down the new mission file. Will add a small web GUI for dashboard and user management.
